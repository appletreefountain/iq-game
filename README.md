# IQ Game

This is a game that is based on the visual memorization portion of the abbreviated IQ test found under https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/FSIQ/. Playable under https://appletreefountain.github.io/iq-game/iq.html.

# Rules

A random arrangement of squares is shown on a grid at the beginning of each round. After a short time for the player to memorize the arrangement, the player is challenged to re-create the same arrangement from memory. The difficulty grows as the player progresses from level to level. Any mistakes will set the player back by one level. 

# Correlation With IQ

According to rough observations, lower levels appear to correspond to the difficulty of someone scoring in the 80s range in the memory sub-portion of an IQ test. Level 10 or so gets in the 90-100 range. Levels around 15 are probably around IQ 120. Levels above 20 would roughly place you in the 135+ IQ range. However, this is a game first and foremost so it is not tuned for accuracy with or correspondence to proper IQ tests. The original test mentioned above only offers arrangements that remain static between reruns of the test, so this game is a randomized version of a portion of that memorization subtest that appeared to be one of the most enjoyable portions of the test. It might also turn out to be a fun and effective way to exercise one's memory.

I dislike this sort of boilerplate about how people might receive this but no one should feel too bad about not doing well on either the test above or this game. If you feel that your memory is bad, there are many techniques to aide one's memory, such as memory palace or mnemonic major system. Incredible feats of memorization have been accomplished by people who, without use of such techniques, never felt as if they had a particularly good memory.

While our IQs have been shown to strongly correlate with many positive life outcomes one should remember that any such general distributions also contain outliers. Neither do individual IQ scores towards the lower end of the distribution curve fate you towards failure in life nor do high IQ scores guarantee you success. Pursue whatever your goals might be and enjoy this game.
