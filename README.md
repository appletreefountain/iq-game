# IQ Game

This is a game that is based on the visual memorization portion of the abbreviated IQ test found under https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/FSIQ/. Playable under https://appletreefountain.github.io/iq-game/iq.html.

# Rules

A random arrangement of squares is shown on a grid at the beginning of each round. After a short time for the player to memorize the arrangement the player is challenged to re-create the same arrangement from memory. The difficulty grows as the player progresses from level to level. Any mistakes will set the player back by one level. 

# Correlation With IQ

According to rough observations, lower levels appear to correspond to the difficulty of someone scoring in the 80s range in the memory sub-portion of an IQ test. Level 10 or so gets in the 90-100 range. Levels around 15 are probably around IQ 120. Levels above 20 would roughly place you in the 135+ IQ range. However, this is a game first and foremost. The test above only offered arrangements that remain static between reruns of the test, so this game is a randomized version of a portion of the memorization subtest that appeared to be one of the most enjoyable portions of the test.
